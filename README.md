# XAI-In-The-Education-Sector
This project applies Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand how government education spending influences learning outcomes such as literacy rates and enrolment levels.
Using a Random Forest Regressor integrated with SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), the model identifies which socioeconomic and policy factors most strongly affect educational performance.

The goal is to support transparent, data-driven policymaking by helping governments and researchers interpret model insights, visualize spending effectiveness, and promote accountability in education governance.
